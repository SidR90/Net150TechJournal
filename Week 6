Lab 6-2 Simple Subnetting in Packet Tracer

Objective: Given a starting network, properly develop a simple subnet scheme for the scenario and implement correctly on routers and connected devices

Goals:

    Identify how many subnets are required based on a network map
    Identify the proper subnet mask to use for the scenario
    Identify the network address, broadcast and useable host range for each subnet
    Assign proper addresses to devices based on their subnet location
    Observe connectivity (pings) when 3 routers are connected
o Do:

    Assign an IP address from the proper subnet to each router interface.
    Assign an IP address from the proper subnet to each PC
        Make sure to include proper default gateway and subnet mask
