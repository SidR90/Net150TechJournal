LAB 9-1: Packet Tracer - Static Routing Class Lab

Objective: Observe and reflect the implications of internetworking when connecting multiple routers

Goals: 

    Understand the limitations of routers to identify networks that are not directly connected
    Configure simple static routes to allow packets to cross multiple routers to a remote network

"Routes" tell routers how to reach other networks.  They don't need to include a lot of information - just the network address, subnet mask, and which of it's interfaces to send out of.

Examples: 
R1(config)#ip route 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.20.2 
R1(config)#ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.2 
R2(config)#ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.20.1 
R2(config)#ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.20.1 
R2(config)#ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.20.1 

Lab 9-2 Static Routing:

Objective: Configure two routers and multiple subnets using static routes

Goals:

    Observe the need for routing tables when interconnecting multiple networks across multiple routers
    Understand the components that  must be included in a routing table entry
    Use static route entries to configure routing tables when connecting two or more routers


Lab:

The class is charged with setting up a network for a small business with 2 sites - West and East.  The organization has been assigned 154.103.16.0/21 as it's network address.  It needs to be subdivided into the following networks:

    SalesWest (300 users)
    FinanceWest (200 users)
    SalesEast (100 users)
    FinanceEast (50 users)
    EAST-WEST link for the routers
