Objectives: Test simple network connectivity using common command-line tools like ping, tracert, and nslookup.  Introduce concepts of IP addresses and hostnames.

Week 1 was just a simple intro about OSI Models

In computer networks a diagnostic tool for displaying the route (path) and measuring transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network is traceroute. This is an effective, easy and simple command tool Network Administrators have at their disposal for quick and easy initial diagnosis of their networks.

Run the command nslookup. This command line tool is used to querying the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain domain name or IP address mapping or for any other specific DNS record. This should leave you with a prompt of “>”.
