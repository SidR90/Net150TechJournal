Lab 11-1: VLANs in Packet Tracer Part 1 


Objective: Demonstrate understanding of VLAN uses and limitations and simple configuration of routing between VLANs

Goals:

    Demonstrate  need and impact of  VLANs on networks
    Recognize the distinction between logical and physical switching
    Determine the difference between Trunk and Access ports
    Configure a switch to support multiple VLANs
    Configure switch access ports
    Configure switch trunk ports

Lab: On 1st Floor Switch, Go to Config/VLAN Database and add the VLANs the switch will support:

    VLAN Number: 10 Name: ENG
    VLAN Number: 20 Name: MKT
    VLAN Number: 30 Name: ACT

Then, configure which ports are in which VLAN from Config tab by changing the VLAN number for the Access Port configuration per interface

    FastEthernet 0/1 can be VLAN 10 (ENG)
    FastEthernet 0/2 can be VLAN 20 (MKT)
    FastEthernet 0/3 can be VLAN 30 (ACT)

Then, configure the Trunk port that will be used to connect the switch to the 2nd Floor Switch

    GigabitEthernet 0/1 change to Trunk and add VLANs 10, 20, and 30 (leaving the other default VLANs checked is fine)
    
    Objective: Demonstrate understanding of VLAN uses and limitations and simple configuration of routing between VLANs

Lab 11-1: VLANs in Packet Tracer Part 2
Goals:

    Configure inter-vlan routing on a multi-layer switch
   
   At the end of Lab 11-1, PC's on the same VLAN should be able to ping each other.  But, without a router acting as the default gateway for each of the VLANs/subnets - the PC's cannot ping PC's on different VLANs.

To fix that, you will now follow the steps to connect the router.  The router has already been configured with the IP addresses to act as Default Gateway for the 3 VLANs

    
  Commands: 
    switchport trunk native vlan 10    (this makes it so any device can read the fram from a VLAN)
    switchport nonegotiate
    exit
