Lab 8-1: Tracing Routes

Objectives

Part 1: Test Network Connectivity Using Ping

Part 2: Trace a Route Using Windows Tracert

Part 3: Compare Traceroute Results

Background

Route tracing computer software is a utility that lists the routers that data has to travel through from source network to destination. This network tool is typically executed at the command line as:

    tracert <destination network name or end device address>  (Microsoft Windows systems)
    traceroute <destination network name or end device address> (Unix and similar systems)

Each router represents a point where one network connects to another network and through which the data packet was forwarded.

The number of routers is known as the number of "hops" the data traveled from source to destination.

Two trace routes between the same source and destination conducted some time apart may produce different results. This is due to the "meshed" nature of the interconnected networks.


For Africa: C:\> ping www.afrinic.net

For Australia: C:\> ping sydney.edu.au as an example of an Austrailan site

For Europe: C:\> ping ns.ripe.net

For South America: C:\> ping lacnic.net

Each “hop” represents a router.

    The tracert tool shows you what path through the network a packet of information takes to reach its final destination.
    The tracert tool also gives you an idea of how fast traffic is going on each segment of the network.
    Three packets are sent to each router in the path, and the return time is measured in milliseconds. 
    
    Which TCP-IP Protocol is responsible for defining the unique address of the source and destination hosts and routing the packets correctly?
    Internet Protocol
