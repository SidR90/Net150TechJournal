Lab 7-2: Simple Subnet Design- Packet Tracer

Objective: Implement the subnet design for the scenario detailed in Lab 7-1 Simple Subnet Design

Goals:

    Provided a subnet design, configure proper IP addresses and subnet masks on the router
    Assign proper IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways to clients in the subnets


Lab Steps:

1. Open up your table from Lab 7-1 that contains the information for the 4 subnets

2. Connect a copper cable from Engineering Switch to the FastEthernet0 interface on the Router

3. Connect copper cables from the Engineering PC's to the Engineering Switch (any port on the switch is fine - but it is helpful to keep them in order)


    Remember: The router is acting as the default gateway for all 4 subnets
    Each interface on the router will need to be assigned the IP address for the router on its respective subnet
    This is typically the first useable IP address on that subnet
