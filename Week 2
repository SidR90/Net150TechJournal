Simple Linux Setup Objective: Configure a node and observe basic connectivity on a simple LAN using the star topology

Goals: 

    Familiarize oneself with bootable USBs and Kali Linux
    Configuring a static address assignment
    Observing the function of a network switch
    Using ping to test connectivity

Boot Into Linux Steps:

Plug the USB thumb drive provided by your instructor into the back of your workstation.
Reboot the workstation. When you see the line "Press <CTRL + P> to enter MEBX setup menu", press F8. This will bring up the boot device menu.
Select "VenderCoProductMode" from the boot menu.
When the MultiBootUSB menu appears, select the "kali-linux-..." option.
Finally, when the Kali menu appears, select the "Live (amd64)" option. 

Observing Lan Activity Objective: In this lab, students will observe traffic in a simple LAN

Goals:

    Understand the role of MAC addresses in LAN communication
    Observe ARP communication
    Introduce basic features of Wireshark and traffic analysis
    
    
   Type "ipconfig /all" (Windows) or "ip route show" (Linux) and record the IP address of the default gateway
   
   ping ip_address_of_gateway
   
   WireShark: TIP: You can filter for ICMP by typing "ICMP" in the Wireshark Display Filter and hitting the "arrow" to apply
