LAB 4-1 Intro to Packet Tracer and Deploying Devices 

Objective: Introduction to the Packet Tracer interface

Goals: 

    Register for Cisco Network Academy account
    Deploy network devices in Packet Tracer
    Cable network devices together in Packet Tracer

To install Packet Tracer for Linux - there is a download link in the “Download Packet Tracer” portion of Cisco’s website.

Lab 4-2 Observing ARP in Packet Tracer 

Lab 4-2: ARP Packet Tracer Lab

Goals:

    To become familiar with Cisco's network emulator tool - Packet Tracer
    To gain some more exposure to Address Resolution Protocol and Ethernet and develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between these two protocols.

Overview:

In this lab, you will use Packet Tracer to simulate a small network consisting of 4 computers and a switch.  You will examine the address table of the switch and ARP tables of the computers. Then you will initiate some communication between the machines and watch the frames.  Analysis of the frame contents will help understand how ARP and Ethernet work.
